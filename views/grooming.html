                    <p>Depending on your dog's size, coat type, and the services you select, our grooming appointments
                        might last anywhere between two and four hours.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>1. Five to ten minutes for a hands-on pet assessment</strong></p>
                    <p>Your pet's skin, coat, ears, nails, and teeth will be evaluated by one of our safety-certified
                        salon staff so that their specific needs may be met. While our stylists do keep an eye out for
                        any behavioral or health issues, this is a perfect opportunity to let us know of any other
                        concerns, preferences, or unique requirements.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>2. Brushing and trimming (10â€“30 minutes) (pre-bath steps</strong></p>
                    <p>Before giving your pet a bath, a pet stylist will first brush, comb, and clip any extra hair or
                        tangles off them. They will also clean the pet's ears and cut its nails.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>3. A soothing bath: 10 to 30 minutes</strong></p>
                    <p>Bath time becomes a peaceful experience thanks to Pets-R-Us's soothing bath system. Your pet will
                        first be washed by your salon professional using the shampoo and conditioner that you chose at
                        check-in. Our entire line of shampoos and conditioners is pH-balanced specifically for pets and
                        offers gentle washing without irritating your pet's skin.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>4. Special Drying: More than 30 minutes</strong></p>
                    <p>Your pet's face, ears, and tail will first be gently dried with a cloth. Our dryers have varying
                        speeds and are not heated. Each pet is carefully dried using the best way for safety and comfort
                        because various breeds have varied needs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>5. Customized Haircut & Finishing Touches: 30 minutes or longer</strong></p>
                    <p>After your pet has been washed and blow-dried, your stylist may guarantee there are no further
                        tangles and give them the best-looking haircut by finishing the haircut. If your pet merely had
                        a wash or de-shedding service, this time will be used to finish brushing them, touch up their
                        nails, clean their ears, and make any final preparations before they are picked up.</p>
